# Recovering a regressed GRTQC actor

Use **Recover champion actor** in Overview or Run setup after stopping training.
This resumes Latest, restores the verified champion actor, and preserves Latest's
critics, replay buffer, reward settings, return horizon, and total training step.
The selected session budget is retained. The champion slot remains protected by
the existing deterministic five-lap promotion gate.

Recovery limits actor learning rate to 0.00002, delays actor updates to at least
every four critic updates, caps individual action drift at 0.01 and cumulative
reference action drift at 0.1. Actor evaluation occurs at least every 2,000
decisions, with recovery after at most two consecutive weaker checks. Existing
stricter limits are retained. The existing critic recovery cooldown still applies.

These settings constrain further regressions; they do not guarantee faster laps.
Ordinary Continue actions still restore the checkpoint's saved settings.

On 2026-10-12, Simple Track's protected champion was 33.591 seconds over five
completed deterministic laps. Latest was stopped safely at step 1,544,539 before
recovery, with its policy and metadata archived locally. The active run had actor
LR 0.0001, update interval 2, no cumulative reference drift limit, and five weak
checks before recovery. Its critics and 250,000-transition replay were retained.
